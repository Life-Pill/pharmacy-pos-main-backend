## Description

The Pharmacy POS System Backend is the server-side component of our comprehensive pharmacy management software. It is developed using Spring Boot, Java, and integrates seamlessly with the frontend built on Electron, React, and Tailwind CSS. This backend system handles various critical functionalities such as database management, API endpoints for communication with the frontend, authentication, security, and business logic implementation.

## Features

- **Database Management:** Utilizes Spring Data JPA for efficient database management, enabling CRUD operations and data manipulation.
  
- **API Endpoints:** Provides RESTful API endpoints for communication with the frontend, facilitating seamless data exchange and interaction.
  
- **Authentication:** Implements secure authentication mechanisms to ensure only authorized access to the system.
  
- **Security:** Incorporates security measures such as input validation, encryption, and access control to protect sensitive data and prevent security breaches.
  
- **Business Logic Implementation:** Implements business logic for various pharmacy operations including order processing, inventory management, sales tracking, and employee management.
  
- **Integration with Frontend:** Integrates seamlessly with the frontend application, enabling smooth communication and synchronization of data between the frontend and backend systems.
  
- **Scalability:** Built with scalability in mind, allowing the system to handle growing data volumes and increasing user demands effectively.
  
- **Logging and Monitoring:** Implements logging and monitoring functionalities to track system activities, diagnose errors, and ensure smooth operation.
  
- **Testing:** Includes unit tests and integration tests to verify the functionality and reliability of the backend components.
